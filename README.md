Homestay (also home stay and home-stay) is a form of hospitality and lodging whereby visitors share a residence with a local of the area (host) to which they are traveling.
A homestay provides an opportunity to stay with a local family for a fee.

In addition to offering a way to experience the local culture first-hand, staying with a local family provides you with a broader local network and support system.
